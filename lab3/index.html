<h1> Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
<p>The Purpose of this lab was to show how to navigate a local
	file structure, and prove it in the index.hmtl file.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>The lab was relatively easy for me, but my challenges for this lab
		were having internet problems, and the focus for staying on task.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>I was able to finish the lab quickly however it was a few days
			late.</p>
