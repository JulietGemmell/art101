		<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>

		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>Start working in JavaScript with different variables</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p> The only problems I had with this challenge was mistaking the "l"
			in writeln for an "I" even though I read the note in the lab.
			I also had doubts about using the browser for the first task.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p> The results speak for themselves in this case, on the index.html
			page. The Program is below this paragrah.</p>
